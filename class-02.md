# HTML:
## TEXT in html:
in **html** there are many elements to put a text to apears on our pages (in headings, subheadings, paragraphs..etc), for exampel:
```
- <p></p> for paragraph
- <h1></h1> <h2></h2> .... <h6></h6> 
```
and many more.

we can use **key feautres** inside the tags to make the text bold, italc ...etc.
**ex:**
`` 
- <b></b> to make the text bold.
- <i></i> to make the text italc.
and more.

## Css:

**CSS's** rules determines how the specified elements will displayed on the web page.
. All **CSS** rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
- Selectors : determines wich element is applies to.
- Declarations: is determines the style that will applies to the elements  referred to in the selector.
Declarations are split into two parts: **a property and a value** .

somthing like: background color, font size and style and color, align text ...etc, can be determines with **CSS**.
**Css** code can be added inside the **html** code by tow ways:
1. inside the head tags(between the oppining and closing tag).
and this called **internal styling** 
2. inside the tag it self which we want to style it.
and this called **inline styling** .

We can use a spreat sheet for all html pages, and this **External styling**.

### Why use External Style Sheets?
- the page could load faster. 
- If we want to make a change to how our site appears, we only need to edit the one **CSS** file.

## JavaScript:
***JavaScript*** is a programming language that rules a set of instructiond which computer can follw:

in the process of making a **JS** code we can use **comments** that can be helpful to make our code easier to understand.
ex:
```
//here we make an input of our value
```
**variables** : we use the variables to store a data. variables have a value.
ex:
```
var name = 'Ahmad':
```
**Data type**:
in JS we have data types such as:

- __NUMERIC DATA TYPE:__
The numeric data type handles numbers. ex: 5 , 0.96

- __STRING DATA TYPE:__
The strings data type consists of letters and other characters betweena '' . ex: '12g' , 'maha'

__BOOLEAN DATA TYPE:__
Boolean data types can have one of two values: **true or false**. 

## Arrays:
**array** is a type of variable which stores a list of values.
ex:
``` 
var name;
name ['Ahmad', 'Saleem', 'Waleed'];
```
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. the numbering of this list starts at zero.

### Conditional statements:
the Conditional statements used to make a decisions by the code itself.

in Conditional statements we usethe **Comparison operators**:
 - ===, !==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, => .
 there is another operators called **the Logical operators**, these operators allow us to compine tow or more of comparison operators.

## Loops:
There are three types of loop:
1. for.
2. while.
3. do ..while. 
and Each repeats a set of statements. but With a difference in the way and when they used.
