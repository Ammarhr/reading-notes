## the Lists in HTML:
In **HTML** we have three type of lists:
1. **Orderd lists** that lists itms using numbers. 
```
<ol></ol>
```
2. **Unorderd lists**  that lists itms using points.
```
<ul></ul>
```
3. **Definition lists**: this list used to define terminology, and usally contain itms and  thier definitions.
```
<dl></dl>
it's usally contain <dt> and <dd> used to put the definitions inside it.
```
### Boxes and Css:
to understand how **Css** work with **html** we should know that **css** process the **html** elements as a **Boxes**. so we can set various properties that affect how the **Boxes** (element) will be desiplay.

#### How to control the boxes?
we can  control these boxes by control its dimensions and creat border around the boxes and we can sed margin and padding. and we can make is visible or hidden.


### The overflow property:
It tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself.
we gave tow values of The overflow property:
1. **Hidden:** it is hides all the extra content content that does not fit in
the box.
2. **Scroll:** it is adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the extra content that doesn't fit in our box.

## JS:
## IF ... else and Swutch:
We can use both of **If ...else statement and Switch statement:** for mostly the same purpose  wich is to excute a statement with specific conditions.
In case of **siwtch** the code will run faster and esier in case we have many conditions to deal with.

### Loops:
we use *loops* to repeate excuting a code to achive our goal.
There are three types of loop:
1. for: we use for loop if we know the number of time that the code would run.
2. while: we use for loop if we don't know the number of time that the code would run.
3. do ..while: it is similar to while loop, but here we have a kay(do) that will run the code once atleast.
