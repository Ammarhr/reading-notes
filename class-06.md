## Problem domain :
# whay the Proplem Domain is the hardest part of programming?
The key of start coding is understanding **the problem domain**. without understand the problem domain you will face a big issues and obstacles through writting the code. it will be harder to fixing the bugs that you may face during testing your code.
### How "understanding the problem domain" make Programming easier?
ِAs long as the problem domain is the main key to start a cone in athe right way, the understanding of it will make the obstacles that you think is very Complicated to become super easy.

### How to Make the problem domain easier?
To get better at understanding *the problem domain* you can divide the problem to small pieces and solve it one by one. it is helpful to understandthe problem from inside out. you will save the time during programming.

## Create an Objects:
There are many  ways to create an object but the easiest way is **Literal Notation**.


### The Document Object Model (DOM) :
**DOM** detrmine the way that the browser will represent the web page using a model called **DOM tree**.
This model **(DOM tree)** is created by the browser itself when it load the page and it will be stored(dom tree) in the memory of the browser.

#### DOM Trees:
**DOM trees** have four types:
- THE DOCUMENT NODE.
- ELEMENT NODES.
- ATTRIBUTE NODES.
- TEXT NODES.

##### how to select element nodes?
we can select *element nodes* by seviral ways:
- Tag name ```getElementsByTagName('tagName')``` 
- class attributes ```getElementsByClassName('class')```
- id attributes ```getElementByld('id')``` 
- **Css** selector dyntax ```querySelector('css selector')```
