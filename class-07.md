## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. the model could contain entities and their behaviors and attributies.
**object-oriented:** the entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.

### Updating an Object:
We can update values of any propreties using dot notation or aquare brakets. those tools create using literal or constructor notation. we can use **delete** key to delete a propreties.
We can use a **constructor function** To define the same properties between many objects.
ex:

``function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}``


## Tables in HTML:

A **table** represents information in a grid format. 
```<table>``` tage used to add a table to the web page.
there are many tags follow ```<table>``` tage:

- ```<tr>``` for creat a start row and follwed by ```<td>``` instad to add cells of row.
